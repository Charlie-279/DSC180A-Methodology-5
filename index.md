Section: Hierarchical Latent Variable Models for Neural Data Analysis (A04)

Mentor: Mikio Aoi

1. The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been Variational Auto-encoders. Previously, all of the machine learning related content I've learned in my classes has been within the confines of supervised learning, so unsupervised learning was a relatively new concept for me. I still haven't fully wrapped my head around how to represent data in a lower-dimensional space without significantly lowering model accuracy, but I want to learn more on this subject. Variational Auto-encoders are a way to generate new data in the form of a lower-dimensional latent variable space.
2. For my Quarter 2 project, a potential investigation I would like to perform is using Variational Auto-encoders on the neural datasets that my mentor will be giving my section. In particular, creating multi-modal VAEs sounds interesting to be, especially since my group has researched it and there is not very much existing research on that subject, at least not in regards to multimodal neural datasets.
3. One potential change I would make to the approach my group has been taking for the Quarter 1 Project is to communicate with our instructor more. In my meetings with my project group, we have shared the sentiment that we are often finding ourselves confused by the material our mentor is teaching us.
4. In my project, I would be interested in making an effort to contact either a member of last year's group for my mentor's capstone section, or someone who has a research paper related to my topic. I feel that this could help me understand the concepts in my section more clearly, since I haven't been able to wrap my head around a lot of it yet.
